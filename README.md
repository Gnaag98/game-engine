# game-engine
Learning computer graphics by making a game engine. I want to know the math behind the different rendering techniques so I'll start with calculating everything myself and, when I have to, move things over to OpenGL. I started by rendering each frame to a separate .ppm file and later combining then into a GIF in Photoshop. The next step is to use OpenGL to render the array of pixels to the screen. My goal is to first implement all functionality myself and then eventually let OpenGL handle the computation when I feel that I understand the underlying process.
